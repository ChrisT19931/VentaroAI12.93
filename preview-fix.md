# Preview Fix Instructions

The Next.js server is running correctly at http://localhost:3003, but there seems to be an issue with the IDE's preview functionality. Here are some solutions to access your website:

## Option 1: Access Directly in Browser

The most reliable way to view your website is to open http://localhost:3003 directly in your browser.

## Option 2: Use the Static Preview

I've created a static HTML preview that shows how your updated website looks. You can open the `static-preview.html` file in your browser to see a representation of the changes made.

## Option 3: Troubleshoot IDE Preview

If you want to fix the IDE preview functionality:

1. Try restarting the IDE
2. Check if there are any browser security settings blocking the preview
3. Ensure the IDE has permission to open external URLs
