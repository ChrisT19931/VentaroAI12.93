This would be a PDF file containing the AI Business Accelerator Checklist. Since I cannot create actual PDF files, this is a placeholder. In a real implementation, you would:

1. Create a proper PDF with the 30-point checklist
2. Include actionable steps for launching an AI business
3. Add checkboxes and progress tracking
4. Include timelines and milestones
5. Provide resource links and templates

The checklist would cover:
- Market research and niche selection
- AI tool setup and configuration
- Content creation workflows
- Client acquisition strategies
- Pricing and service packages
- Automation and scaling
- Legal and business setup
- Marketing and branding
- Customer service systems
- Revenue optimization

This file should be replaced with an actual PDF created using tools like Adobe Acrobat, Canva, or similar design software.
