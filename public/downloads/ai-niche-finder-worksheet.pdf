This would be a PDF worksheet for finding profitable AI niches. Since I cannot create actual PDF files, this is a placeholder. In a real implementation, you would:

1. Create an interactive PDF worksheet
2. Include 7 step-by-step exercises
3. Add fillable fields and checkboxes
4. Provide market research templates
5. Include competitor analysis frameworks

The worksheet would cover:
Step 1: Skills and Interest Assessment
Step 2: Market Demand Analysis
Step 3: Competition Research
Step 4: Profit Potential Evaluation
Step 5: AI Tool Requirements
Step 6: Target Audience Definition
Step 7: Niche Validation Process

This file should be replaced with an actual PDF created using form-capable PDF tools with interactive elements.
