-- NOTES
-- ============================================================
-- 
-- To use these utilities:
-- 1. Copy individual sections to Supabase SQL Editor
-- 2. Run them as needed for monitoring and maintenance
-- 3. Modify date ranges and filters as required
-- 4. Use the functions for application integration
--
-- For regular monitoring, consider running:
-- - User activity summary (query #2)
-- - Purchase statistics (query #4)
-- - Database health check (query #15)
