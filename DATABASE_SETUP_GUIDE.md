# Database Setup Guide

## Current Status
✅ **Application is now working with mock data!**

The products API has been updated to use mock data when the database tables don't exist, so you can test the full buy-to-checkout flow immediately.

## Quick Test
1. Visit: http://localhost:3000
2. Browse products
3. Add items to cart
4. Test the checkout flow

## Setting Up Real Database (Optional)

To use a real Supabase database instead of mock data:

### Option 1: Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to your Supabase project: https://bamqdxclctzwyplecoxt.supabase.co
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy and paste the contents of `scripts/create-tables.sql`
4. Click **Run** to execute the SQL
5. Restart your development server: `npm run dev`

### Option 2: Manual SQL Execution
Run these commands in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Create products table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS products (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  image_url TEXT,
  file_url TEXT,
  category TEXT,
  featured BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE
);

-- Enable Row Level Security
ALTER TABLE products ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policy for public access
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view active products" ON products
  FOR SELECT USING (is_active = true);

-- Insert sample products
INSERT INTO products (name, description, price, image_url, category, featured, is_active) VALUES
(
  'AI Tools Mastery Guide 2025',
  '30-page guide with AI tools and AI prompts to make money online in 2025. Learn ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, Gemini, and proven strategies to make money with AI.',
  25.00,
  '/images/products/ai-tools-mastery-guide.svg',
  'E-book',
  true,
  true
),
(
  'AI Prompts Arsenal 2025',
  '30 professional AI prompts to make money online in 2025. Proven ChatGPT and Claude prompts for content creation, marketing automation, and AI-powered business growth.',
  10.00,
  '/images/products/ai-prompts-arsenal.svg',
  'AI Prompts',
  true,
  true
),
(
  'AI Business Strategy Session 2025',
  '60-minute coaching session to learn how to make money online with AI tools and AI prompts. Get personalized strategies to build profitable AI-powered businesses in 2025.',
  497.00,
  '/images/products/ai-business-strategy-session.svg',
  'Coaching',
  true,
  true
);
```

## Verification

After setting up the database:
1. Check the server logs for "Database table not found, using mock data" messages
2. If you see this message, the database setup needs to be completed
3. If you don't see this message, the database is working correctly

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still seeing mock data after database setup
- Restart your development server: `npm run dev`
- Check Supabase dashboard for any errors
- Verify the table was created in the correct schema (public)

### Issue: Database connection errors
- Verify your `.env.local` file has correct Supabase credentials
- Check your Supabase project is active and accessible
